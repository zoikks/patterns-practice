# Patterns
Sample source code for different programming patterns in Java.

Most, if not all, code and documentation was found on the web at the following locations:

https://www.journaldev.com/1827/java-design-patterns-example-tutorial#abstract-factory-pattern
https://springframework.guru/gang-of-four-design-patterns/

Additionally, information and sample code came from Pluralsight (https://www.pluralsight.com).  Specifically from the 
"Design Patterns in Java: Creational", "Design Patterns in Java: Structural" and "Design Patterns in Java: Behavioral"
sections.

**Creational Patterns:** These patterns provide solutions to instantiate an object 
in the best possible way for specific solutions.

- Singleton
- Factory:  Abstracts the way objects are created.
- Abstract Factory:  Abstract factory abstracts how the factories are created. (aka “factory of factories“.)
- Builder
- Prototype


**Structural Design Patterns:** Provides different ways to create a class structure.
For example, using inheritance and composition to create a large object from small 
objects.

This pattern is widely used in the JDK, Spring and Struts.

- Adapter
- Composite
- Proxy
- Flyweight
- Facade
- Bridge
- Decorator


**Behavioral Design Patterns:** Provide solutions for better interaction between 
objects and how to provide loose coupling and flexibility to extend easily.

- Template Method
- Mediator
- Chain of Responsibility
- Observer
- Strategy
- Command
- State
- Visitor
- Interpreter
- Iterator
- Memento
